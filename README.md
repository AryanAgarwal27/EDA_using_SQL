## Apple Store Data Analysis
This repository contains SQL queries for the exploratory data analysis of Apple Store data, focusing on app ratings, genres, pricing, and user reviews.

### Table Creation
The SQL code includes the creation of a new table (applestore_description) by combining data from multiple tables (appleStore_description1, appleStore_description2, appleStore_description3, appleStore_description4) using the UNION ALL operation.

* Checking the number of unique apps in both tables.
* Identifying missing values in key fields.
* Finding the number of apps per genre.
* Overview of app ratings, including minimum, maximum, and average ratings.

## Data Analysis
The data analysis section includes SQL queries to determine whether paid apps have higher ratings than free apps, check if there is a correlation between the number of supported languages and ratings, identify genres with low ratings, and explore the relationship between the length of app descriptions and user ratings.

## Conclusion
The conclusion section summarizes key findings from the data analysis, including insights into app ratings based on pricing, language support, genres, and app description lengths.
